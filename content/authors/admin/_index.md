Hi. I am Jaro&#x6E;. I will spruce up my bio at some point. For the moment, just know I am a plodder trying to get along in this world. At this stage I don't have any set plans for this blog; I was mostly interested in seeing if I could set it up. My interim plan is to write some posts on subjects that I am interested in. I suspect there won't be  a lot, but I will give it a go.

*Afableco* means friendliness, affability and kindness in Esperanto. I would like to think that describes me, but sometimes I worry I am more like [Larry Underwood](https://stephenking.fandom.com/wiki/Larry_Underwood) - just less interesting.

I follow the [Giants Netball](https://giantsnetball.com.au/) team in the [Super Netball](https://supernetball.com.au/).

I live and work on the land of the [Ngunnawal people](https://www.act.gov.au/ngunnawal-country). I pay my respects to their Elders past, present and emerging.
