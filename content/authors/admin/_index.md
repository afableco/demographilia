Hi. I am Jaron. 

Currently, I don't have any long-term plans for this blog; I was mostly interested in seeing if I could set it up using `blogdown`. My interim plan is to write some posts on subjects that I am interested in. I suspect there won't be a lot, but I will give it a go. I need the practice writing.

*Afableco* means friendliness, affability and kindness in Esperanto.

I follow the [Giants Netball](https://giantsnetball.com.au/) team in the [Super Netball](https://supernetball.com.au/).

While I don't expect that I will be writing too many things here that would conflict with the views of my employer, I note that the views on this website are my own and not my employer.

I live and work on the land of the [Ngunnawal people](https://www.act.gov.au/ngunnawal-country). I pay my respects to their Elders past, present and emerging.
