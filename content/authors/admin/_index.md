title: Afableco
---

I am too embarassed to say who I am -- maybe later. For the moment, just know I a plodder trying to get along in this world.

The word *Afableco* is the Esperanto word for affability, kindness. I would like to think that discribes me, but sometimes I worry I am more like Larry Underwood - just less interesting.

I follows the [Giants Netball](https://giantsnetball.com.au/) team in the [Super Netball](https://supernetball.com.au/).

I live on the land of Ngunnawal people, who are the Traditional Custodians of the ACT.
