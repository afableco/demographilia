I am too embarassed to say who I am -- maybe later. For the moment, just know I am a plodder trying to get along in this world. I strive to be a better person, but I rarely make progress.

*Afableco* means friendliness, affability and kindness in Esperanto. I would like to think that describes me, but sometimes I worry I am more like Larry Underwood - just less interesting.

I follow the [Giants Netball](https://giantsnetball.com.au/) team in the [Super Netball](https://supernetball.com.au/).

I live and work on the land of [Ngunnawal people](https://www.act.gov.au/ngunnawal-country). I pay my respects to their Elders past, present and emerging.
