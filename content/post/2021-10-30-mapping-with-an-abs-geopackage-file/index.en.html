<p>I want to improve my mapping skills in R. The <a href="http://abs.gov.au">Australian Bureou of Statistics (ABS)</a> are now preparing spatial data in an open format called <a href="https://www.geopackage.org/">GeoPackage</a>, so I thought I would write a post on how I used an ABS dataset to prepare a map. Just a quick word of warning: I plodded through this, so I will try and point out some of the traps I had to work through, but this is not a master class and my terminology is not going to necessarily align with people that know what they are talking about.</p>
<p>In this post I will cover off on:</p>
<ul>
<li>where I sourced the data;</li>
<li>which R packages I used;</li>
<li>how I worked in my own data;</li>
<li>things I learned along the way;</li>
<li>problems that I needed to overcome.</li>
</ul>
