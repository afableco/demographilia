This year was the first time I have ever tried my hand in a fantasy sports competition. My eldest daughter was keen, so I thought it would be a bit of fun. I must admit  I didn't really give it a lot of thought before hand. I picked a team that I thought looked good - it was slightly Giants heavy - and the season was under way. Round 1 and Keira Austin goes down with a ruptured ACL. My season did not look up from there, and to add salt to the wound my daugter was beating me consistantly each week.

So, I want to get a bit of a hang on how to pick a good team. In this post, I want to look at which team would have been the ultimate fantasy netball team. My initial plan is just to look at starting teams with no changes for the year. I would look at the ultimate team with weekly trades, up to the limit, but I am sure the computational load of doing that would be enormous. I would have to find some huristic.
